                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod''s restart policy
                        and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always"
                        for the init container will have the following effect: this
                        init container will be continually restarted on exit until
                        all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers
                        have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init
                        containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container.
                        Although this init container still starts in the init container
                        sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
                        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init
                        container starts immediately after this init container is
                        started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.'

                                init container will be continually restarted on exit

                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe

                                init container will be continually restarted on exit

                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe
